PlotWeaponGemEFR.m is probably what you are interested in. Once added to your
MATLAB path, you can call it using, for example:

% For 220 base attack (whether on weapon or from armor skills), 10% Affinity
% (whether on weapon or from armor skills), % 0 level 1 deco slots, 1 level 1
% deco slot, 2 level 3 deco slots:

PlotWeaponGemEFR(220, 10, [0;1;2]) 

PlotEFR.mlx is the live script I used to make the EFR heatmap animations.
